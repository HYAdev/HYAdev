### üêà About Me
**`Music Producer/Programmer/Cybersecurer`**

Yahallo! I'm currently a student that enjoys many aspects of Computer Science. I am competing in **CyberPatriot**, which is a hardening competition hosted by the US' Air Force and Space Association (AFA), where my primary focus is Windows. I am continuously honing my cybersecurity skills through **CTFs**. In my free time, I upload original songs to my YouTube channel, [HYAmusic](https://www.youtube.com/c/HYAmusic), which has over 120 subscribers as of now (*please subscribe*). My speciality genres are pop, funk, chill, etc. In the future, I hope to learn more about competitive programming (for data structures, algorithms, etc.) and artificial intelligence. Also, I really love cats.
